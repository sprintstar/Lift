# Lift Software

I am building this project for the following reasons:

* Improve my GIT skills
* Learn typescript
* Learn about module systems and utilise RequireJS
* Realise my life-long dream of writing lift software

I have always thought that lift software would be really fun to write.  It has the following challenges:

* The complexity of the desision making process - does the lift stop, go up or down etc
* Handling lots of input requests (https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs?)
* Visualisation of lifts - Lift control centre UI - (https://vuejs.org/?)
* Testing - Simulating users
* Scalability - Add more lift shafts etc
* Optimazion and performace - What are the bottle necks ? How many people can I transport?
